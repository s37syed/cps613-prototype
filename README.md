This is a project's user interface based on a prototype constructed in our Human-Computer Interaction course.This project followed specific requirements, and was completed iteratively based on user requirements analysis, conceptual design, early formulative evaluation via paper mockup design, and finally conceptualized through a usability testing plan.  This user interface follows a direct manipulation paradigm.
