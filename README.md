cps613-prototype
================

This is a complete user interface based on a prototype constructed in our Human-Computer Interaction course, called KidWatch. KidWatch is a wearable device for children aged 7-11. This project followed specific requirements, and was completed iteratively based on user requirements analysis, conceptual design, early formulative evaluation via paper mockup design, and finally conceptualized through a usability testing plan.  This user interface follows a direct manipulation paradigm. 

The project was completed by myself, cjmcdona (Christopher McDonald), redballs (Andrew May), and dan3106 (Daniel Kozij).
